Code Quality:
	The class has high cohesion and loose coupling. Though static, the class
	itself must only have one instance or else spritesheets may be loaded more 
	than once or even unloaded without notice. All methods perform one action,
	in a clean fashion. There are a multitude of functions, but, all are needed 
	for	the current implementation of the project.
Hypothetical Change:
	If another state of Mario was implemented that required new sprites, such
	as Star Mario, all the MarioSpriteFactory would need to do is load the new 
	spritesheet, if applicable, and then create a new function that would return
	the new ISprite. This would be quite an easy change to make to the class.
