Review:
	Following the phillosophies of state pattern design, I would say this is a quality piece
	of code. The code is cohesive, as it only deals with dead Mario state transitions. The code
	is about as low-coupled as it can be, as there will always need to be some dependencies
	other Mario states following state pattern design. One change to implement for Sprint 3 
	will be the removal of unnecessary transitions needed for Sprint 2, as from the dead state,
	no other state should be reachable.
