Code Quality:
	The block class is very well constructed with no unneeded coupling. 
	It uses methods to allow outside calls to use its fields without having to call the fields themselves
	and therefor further increases code cohesion and completeness throughout the program. the only "code smell"
	is the long variable chain used in the draw calls, but these do not add any real problems to the code's cleanness 
	or reusability.

Hypothetical Change:
	One hypothetical change would be if the user wanted to add the number of blocks available to be used. In this
	case all that would need to be done would be to insert the new blocks into the switch cases and they would be simply implemented
	for this class.
