Readability:
	All of the methods are clearly titled such that their purpose is made clear to the reader immediately.
	The method bodies themselves are structured so that it is very easy to follow along with what they do and
	when they call an outside class or method, those titles make it easy to realize what is happening and where 
	those actions are taking place.
