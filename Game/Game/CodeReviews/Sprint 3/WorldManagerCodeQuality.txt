Code Quality:
	The code in the world manager is very succinct. There is a seemingly high
	amount of strong coupling, but there is only what is absolutely necessary due to
	the nature of a worldManager class. Overall the code is very well refactored for its
	purposes.
Hypothetical Change:
	One change could be if you wanted to be able to call and alter different objects aside 
	from mario, and that could be easily added/implemented by repeating what was done for mario but for 
	other objects such as enemy or items.
