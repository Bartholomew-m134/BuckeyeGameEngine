Comments: The class is very cohesive, as it only deals with star Mario, 
and has fairly low coupling, other than having a strict reliance on
the MarioInstance class. A change that could be made would be to remove some unnessary methods such as
land(), and to give methods more specific names. Also for future sprints some parts will need modified
for physics handling.
