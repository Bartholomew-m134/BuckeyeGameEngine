Code Quallity:
	Very high cohesion since the class only handels MarioBlock collsions. Coupling is somewhat low, with
	references to Block, IMario, and Collision. However, these are needed to correctly make the class. 
	Each method is short and clean, and the all fields are private.
Hypothetical Addition:
	If a new block is added, nothing would need changed unless the neww block had a specical attribute.
	If the block is something new, a simple addition to the if-else for each side to then call the 
	special attribute of the block. Overall, a minimal change.
