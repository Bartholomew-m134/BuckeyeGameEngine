Readability:
	Constructor is pretty easy to read but it may be better to
	handle determining which object is IMario to be in a private method.
	All methods are written very cleanly and short except for HandleBottomSide().
	However, HandleBottomSide() is not badly written and must have
	the extra actions to resolve more specifc conditions than the
	other sides.
