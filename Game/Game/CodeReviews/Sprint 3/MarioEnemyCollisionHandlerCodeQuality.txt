Comments: The class is very cohesive, it is soley responsible for handling the
collisions between Mario and Enemies. The logic implemented handles all cases 
for collisions between Mario and enemies, thus it is complete. It does not
contain unnecessary or unavoidable dependencies, so coupling is low. 
A hypothetical change that would require refactoring would be adding another
state that changes how Mario interacts with enemies, such as a 
"recently damaged" state in which he passes through enemies without taking 
damage would require adding more logic to the handler, but it would not
be very difficult to add and is unavoidable regardless.
