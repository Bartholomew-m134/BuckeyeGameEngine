Code Readability:
		This class is slighty complex, but it is justified by the amount of 
		responsibilities a game state has. The class is still very readable and easy 
		to trace through to determine functionality. As usual, your variable and 
		method names make it very evident what the objects are/their purpose and how 
		they are being modified. Good job here.
