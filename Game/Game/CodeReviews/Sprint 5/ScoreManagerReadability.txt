Code Readability:
		IncreaseScore is readable but very complicated. Update has many modifiers being updated which can be hard to understand at quick glance.
		Shell and stomp sequences could be handled with a mod equals instead of conditions that reset to zero. Otherwise, naming and overall 
		readability is quite simple and nice. One improvement that could be made though is removing the zero constants, since zero is not considered
		a magic number.
