Comments: The sound effect manager is very cohesive, as it only serves the purpose of managing sound effects.
It doesn't even handle background effects, so its purpose is very specific. The class has very loose coupling
as it has no dependencies on other classes. A hypothetical change to make that would impact it would be adding any
new sound effect, but implementation would be very simple, thus it is very maintainable and reusable. I have no
criticisms of this class.
