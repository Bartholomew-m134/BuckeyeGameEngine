Comments: This code has a high amount of tight coupling throughout, however due to the nature of a game state, this is necessary.
When taking this into account, this class has an acceptable level of coupling. There is also high cohesion, with the individual methods 
making sure to handle everything necessary and no more, ensuring that everthing is sufficiently modular and functional.

A hypothetical change would be if you wanted to add more potential states to the system, which given the current coding of the
class allows for simply creating a new method for every new type of state. Everything is kept as a simple state system, meaning that 
new/ methods control functionality by linking together the separate states.
