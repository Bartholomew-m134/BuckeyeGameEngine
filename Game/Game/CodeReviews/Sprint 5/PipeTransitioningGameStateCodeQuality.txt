Code Quality:
		The overall quality of this game state class is great. As far as cohesion, it handles all
		of the necessary responsibilities that a game state should. Everything contained in the class
		certainly belongs there. As far as coupling, all of the fields are private and does not 
		expose much data to other areas of the program, except where it is absolutely necessary. 
		There are many different types of objects used in the class, however they are of interface
		type, and a game state needs to know about these things to function properly. A proposed change 
		to this class would be to make it so mario is able to go into pipes from any direction. Ex., 
		mario could enter this game state by jumping up into a pipe, or going left or right into 
		a pipe.
