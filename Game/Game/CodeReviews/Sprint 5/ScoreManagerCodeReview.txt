Code Quality:
	The class has a large amount of ints needed to defein timers or streaks.  Coupling is quite low, only requiring
	SpriteFont, Vector2 and HUD/Life Managers. As for cohesion, the class has a moderate amount of cohesion, mainly
	due to the class having to draw the score instead of a sprite class. Besides that, the class could improve the
	readability of the class, but if the spriteFont functionality is moved elsewhere, the class would be acceptable.
Hypothetical Addition:
	If another score sequence needed to be added, one would have to add an additional method to handle the score
	to add, but also add to the corresponding collision to then detect the sequence.
