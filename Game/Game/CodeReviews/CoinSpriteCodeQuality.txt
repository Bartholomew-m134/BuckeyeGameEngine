	This overall code quality of this file is very good. It is very cohesive in the fact that 
	all of the included objects and methods are related to the subject matter of the class
	as a whole. It also has fairly low coupling because it is mostly independent of other classes,
	and primarily depends on objects declared within itself and the interface it implements. The
	overall desired functionality is consise and lacks any serious code smells.
