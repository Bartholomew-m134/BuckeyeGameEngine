Comments on code quality:
	The quality of this code is very good. The code is simple and robust. This nature of the
	code causes it to be more maintanable and readable. The variables declared just inside the 
	the class are also private, preventing the client from making any serious changes. 
Hypothetical Change:
	One hypothetical change would be if the coins flipped vertically rather than horizontally.
	This file would support it as long as the sprites were arranged in the spritesheet in the
	same places as the existing horizontal flipping coins are now. This change would not be 
	supported if the coins were put into different spots on the spritesheet.
