Comments on Code Quality: Class is well implemented and serves only a single purpose. Methods are complete and well
written. Hardcoding the destinationRectangle coordinates in this Sprint is functionally fine however,
adding a hypothetical change such as making the sprites move would require changing the hardcoded coordinates.
