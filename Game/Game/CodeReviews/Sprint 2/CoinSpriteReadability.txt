Readability:
	This file is overall very readable. The variable names are meaningful and the structure is organized.
	The functionalities of the methods are easy to understand without any sort of contract or comment. 
	The only slight lack of readability is with the inclusion of magic numbers while calculating and 
	drawing the current frames.
