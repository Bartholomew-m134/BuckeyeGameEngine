Code Readability:
		This class is very readable. The naming pattern for all of the methods,
		fields, and magic numbers make it very obvious what is happening at 
		all locations in the class. The class is also fairly compact for the 
		number of responsibilities it has so it does not take long to read 
		through and interpret. Excellent readability here.
