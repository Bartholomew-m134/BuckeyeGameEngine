Code Quality:
	The class has a large amount of fields, however, most would be needed for use in any gamestate class. 
	The fields are only coulped with IGamestate, ICamera, and Game1, meaning a weak coupling.  As for
	the rest of the class, SpriteFactories, CollisionManager, WorldManager, etc. are needed to transition
	from different gamestates but lead to an increased but needed coupling. As for coheasion, the class
	manages the overall updating and drawing of the game through other classes. 
Hypothetical Addition:
	If the level wanted to be loaded was changed, all that would be required is to change the LoadListFromFile
	argument to another string to read another file.
