Comments: The Wolverine Chuck class is very cohesive and contains all the methods necessary to serve its purpose of 
being a boss enemy and has very low coupling. A hypothetical change to add would be to add different movement patterns,
but the implementation of this feature would be very similar to the current movement patterns Chuck currently has, so
such a change would not be difficult.
