Comments: Overall the code is very cohesive, with functions being neatly contained within clearly labeled and segmented methods, with
no discernable overflow. There is a decent amount of coupling due to the fact that the menu must have the ability to call and instantiate
various different game states, which each have their own requirements. sprites are also called, but kept within the proper methods to do so, 
minimizing unnecessary tight coupling.

A hypothetical change could be if you wanted to add or swap the gamestates that the main menu called. With how the menu is written, 
this would be extremely easy. Everything is presented in a linguistic list so that adding and removing objects from the main menu list 
is as simple as removing those object from the list shown in the code, and changing the position numbers to reflect that.
