Code Quality:
		This class has very good code quality. To start, it has an acceptable amount of 
		fields which are all private; this lowers the coupling. The class features the 
		necessary draw and update methods along with a few other methods very specific 
		to the functionality of the paddleball, making the cohesion high. The class also 
		has loose coupling because it uses very few classes from other areas of the program, 
		all of which are interface types, making them more abstract and reusable. 
		One hypothetical change to this class would be to make multiple paddleballs a 
		possibility. Overall, great job on this class.
