Code Readability:
		From the very beginning of the class, the enum structure become clear, and from that fact it becomes
		easy to derive the meaning of the rest of the code. The list that the class produces on the screen can
		be read in the code as a similar list, and so it is easy to figure out where certain functions are within
		the code. All methods and variables are clearly labelled.
