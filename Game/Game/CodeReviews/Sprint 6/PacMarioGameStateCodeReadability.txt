Code Readability:
	Naming of variables and methods are clean and precise. All methods are short and simple except
	for the Update() method which is borderline. There exists two, two deep if statements that 
	determine what gamestate and how to transition to it. This could be improved by making the
	if condition a method call, and thus making only an if-elseif. Otherwise, the file is
	readable.
