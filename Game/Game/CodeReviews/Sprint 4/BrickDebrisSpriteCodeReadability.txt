Code Readability:
		For the most part, very readable. Constructor and Update methods are short and simple. As for the Draw(), there are many declarations of new
		drawing locations, but, it is needed to draw multiple debris at different points. Naming for the entire class is clean and simple. An improvement
		that could be made is combing width and height into a singe Vector2 variable.
