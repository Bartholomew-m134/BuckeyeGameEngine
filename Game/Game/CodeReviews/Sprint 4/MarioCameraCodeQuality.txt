Code Quality:
This code has very limited coupling and what is there is very low. The only repeatedly used outside data is the position information 
passed in in the various methods.All of the methods are separated into their own specific duties and do not take on excessive 
code to handle more than they need to. Overall the class is very well organized and makes sure that it handles all duties 
necessary for the camera to move.

Hypothetical Change: 
If you wanted to change the game into a vertical or left scroller, all that would need to be changed would be the if 
statement in the AdjustCameraPosition method to allow for a checkon Y position change instead of X, or to change the > to a < to 
allow to left movement instead of right. Because the method keeps all data in itself, everthing else will remain unchanged and 
working properly.
