Comments: The class is very cohesive, it is soley responsible for handling the
collisions between two enemies. It does not contain unnecessary or unavoidable dependencies, so coupling is low.
The logic implemented handles all cases for collisions between enemies and enemies, even properly handling
the instance which one enemy can damage other enemies (Koopa shell), so it is complete. A hypothetical change that
would affect the class would be the addition of a new enemy with special abilities, such as an enemy that can 
explode and damage other enemies as well as the player. Adding this enemy would require the addition of different
collision handling logic, but would not be difficult to implement as this class is well designed.
