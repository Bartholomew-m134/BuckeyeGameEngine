Code Readability:
		Overall this class is very readable. The variable names are very descriptive and it is easy for
		the reader to see what the represent exactly. The separation of methods allows the methods themselves 
		allows the separate functionalities to be more clear and readable. I don't see much room at all 
		for improvement. Well done.
