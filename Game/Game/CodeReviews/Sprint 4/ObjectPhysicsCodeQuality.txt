Code Quality:
		This class has overall great quality. The methods are short and concise with
		very cohesive functionalities related to physics. The class features all private
		fields and uses very limited directives making it very loosely coupled. One improvement
		of this would be to create an IPhysics interface in order to have multiple different 
		physics objects with different properties. For example, having moon-like physics on 
		separate platforms.
