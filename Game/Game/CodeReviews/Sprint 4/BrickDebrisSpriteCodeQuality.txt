Code Quality:
	Coupling is low since only reference is to spritebatch and brick debris sprite. The cohesion is high since the class only
	does one thing. Naming and length are acceptable.
Hypothetical Addition:
	If gravity in the world is changed, the appearence of falling blocks will be drastically be different. The falling adjustment 
	would need to be changed to match appearence along with the timer to draw.
