Code Readability:

The code is cohesive, as it only deals with the damaged Mario State transitions. The code has higher coupling, as
it has access to a IMario object, which has quite a few dependencies, although many of these dependencies are
necessary. One hypothetical change to this file would be to make the damage transition more accurate to the real game,
in which mario is shown powering down, instead of just going straight to the invincibility state. Also the file
could have a more specific name, such as DamagedMarioTransitionDecorator.
